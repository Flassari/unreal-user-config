# unreal-user-config
My personal global Unreal Engine config overrides.

# How to use
Clone this repository into `My Documents\Unreal Engine\Engine\Config`. The settings in these ini files will override Unreal Engine Editor and Game configs for all projects and games on your computer.

# What does it do?
These are various tweaks that fit my workstyle that I want to apply to every project on any Editor version I work with.
Example:
- Always use Main Window as the default asset open location.
- Use the Insert key for opening the console (I don't have a US keyboard layout).
